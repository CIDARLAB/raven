                        <hr/>
                        <p>
                            Raven is a DNA assembly design and planning tool. 
                            The tool accepts as its inputs a list of target parts and a parts library. 
                            For any set of target parts, Raven determines an optimized plan for assembling all selected target parts with a particular DNA assembly method while optimizing for time, efficiency and cost. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A unique feature of Raven is its ability to incorporate experimental data to drive the assembly solution. 
                            Raven allows the user to input efficiency information for a variety of parameters and bias or force certain assembly intermediates or overhangs from appearing in the assembly solution. 
                            The tool comes with a set of default parameters that have been experimentally verified, but these values can be modified to the user’s specifications. 
                            This user-interactivity based on experimental data allows users to tailor the assembly solutions to lab- and experiment-specific conditions and recalculate increasingly effective solutions.

                        <hr/>
                        <p>
                            Raven currently supports six cloning-based assembly methods: Gibson [2], MoClo [3], BioBricks(TM) [4], SLIC [5], CPEC [6], and GoldenGate [7].
                            Each of these supported assembly methods has technology-specific constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additional cloning-based assembly method and chemical synthesis assembly are not currently supported. 
                            However, Raven’s core algorithm is highly generalizable and new methods can be added with relative ease. 
                            Please contact the developers if you are interested in an assembly method that is not currently supported.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Raven breaks the DNA assembly problem into two major parts: determining all cloning reactions necessary to achieve the final construct and selecting optimized part junctions based on method-specific constraints. 
                            For a given set of target constructs, the tool first determines an optimized set of assembly steps, then it selects part junctions (overhangs). 
                            Calculations are made in this order because it is assumed that performing a successful assembly step is more costly and time consuming than performing a PCR reaction to get the required overhangs. 
                            This strategy is applied to all supported assembly methods to produce fast, modular and efficient assembly plans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes an experimentalist observes higher or lower assembly efficiencies than realized in the literature due to a number of experimental conditions such as cell competency, specific reaction conditions and other factors. 
                            With Raven, a user is able to adjust the default efficiency numbers guiding the efficiency optimizations. 
                        </p>    
                        <p>    
                            A user may also wish to bias certain intermediates from appearing or not appearing, with or without mandatory inclusion or exclusion. 
                            For example, a user might wish to bias an assembly towards intermediates that fit a certain substructure such as a transcriptional unit. 
                            Another user might also encounter unsuccessful cloning steps or PCRs or wish to test specific intermediate parts or part junctions. 
                            In such cases, it is imperative that these intermediates and/or part junctions are either biased or forced to appear or not appear. 
                        </p>   
                        <p>
                            Raven optimizes around these additional constraints unless they are so restrictive that no valid solution can be found. 
                            Intermediate parts and overhangs can be biased for (recommended), biased against (discouraged), forced or forbidden. 
                            These parts and overhangs can be specified either manually in the GUI or automatically via Eugene [8] scripts.

                        <h3>Integrated Tool Chain</h3>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>
                            Raven is implemented as a ‘stand-alone’ tool, meaning it does not depend on any other tools or databases to provide optimized assembly plans. 
                            However, this tool is designed to connect to a larger tool-chain in the Clotho design automation platform. 
                            This tool chain uses a 'top-down' design flow and begins with the specification of device behavior and ends in physically implemented assembly. 
                        </p>    
                        <p>    
                            One such specification tool in the Clotho design flow is Eugene [8]. 
                            Eugene can generate a set of target devices based on libraries of parts and device design rule sets. 
                            Once all target devices are determined, Raven determines the best way to build all target parts. 
                            These output instructions can be given to a liquid handling robot to automatically assemble these devices from its resources. 
                            This flow allows a user to merely specify the behavior of a set of devices they would like to build and what resources they have to have the devices automatically constructed with liquid handling robots.

                                                    These fields mark the overhangs of the parts generated. 
                                                    These overhangs are variables and not sequences and re-use of parts based on their overhangs is used in the calculation of an optimized assembly plan. 
                                                    Composite parts, basic parts and vectors are all allowed to have overhangs. MoClo assembly plans only recognize overhangs with the numbers 1 -> 256 for re-use. 
                                                    MoClo assembly plans also recognize overhangs with the “*” character as reverse compliments of the standard 256 possible MoClo overhangs (i.e. “1*” is the reverse overhang of overhang “1”).

                                                    Vector field is used to specify which vector a composite part or basic part with overhangs resides in, if applicable. 
                                                    This field is always optional. In homologous recombination-based assemblies, this field is used to denote which vector will be assembled to the construct in the final step. 
                                                    If this field is empty for homologous recombination-based assemblies, no vector is assigned and it is assumed that all parts are to be assembled into a circular product. 
                                                    In BioBricks and Golden Gate assembly if a vector is assigned, it is assigned to all steps and if no vector is assigned, vector pSK1A2 is assigned to all steps. 
                                                    In MoClo assembly, the vector is ignored for a target part, but when re-using parts from the library, it checks this field to determine which vector a library part currently resides in to determine if a new vector must be created.

                                                    Direction is how a user can specify the strand or “direction” of a part within a device. All parts are assumed to be forward or on the leading strand. 
                                                    The two acceptable directions are “+” and “-”. 
                                                    If a part in a device has Direction equal to “-” it is on the lagging or backward strand, all other entries mean the part will be forward.

                                                    For example a device with part “partA|1|2|+” in the composition forces overhang “1” to be assigned to the Left Overhang of partA and overhang “2” to be assigned to the Right Overhang of partA.
                                                    In the former, direction is assumed forward and any overhang from the calculation may be assigned. In the latter, direction is assigned, but overhangs are also unassigned.
